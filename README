Latent Semantic Analysis Similarity Calculator
===
This container is used to perform Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) on short 
texts. This includes the ability to create a semantic space as well as the 
ability to calculate cosine similarity scores on short texts using a semantic 
space.

Running the Tool
===
In order to run the tool, type the following into your terminal
~~~bash
docker run -t -v /local/data/path/:/app/data o76923/lsa
~~~
Where `/local/data/path/` is the path on your local system that contains the 
source information.

Directory Structure
===
The path on your local machine should contain the following
1. The semantic space
1. The texts to be compared
1. A configuration file

Semantic Space
===
The semantic space is the corpus that is used in order to create similarity 
files.

Texts to be Compared
===
The texts to be compared are the short texts that you wish to have compared to 
one another. Similarity scores will be generated between texts with one ID and
texts with another ID.

Configuration File
===
The configuration file specifies the parameters that will tweak how the tool 
behaves. The sections of it are as follows

Tasks
---
There are two main tasks that can be performed by this tool: ***create_space***
and ***calculate_sim***

***create_space***

This task takes input documents and creates a semantic space from them. A 
sample of this section is provided below
~~~
name: IS
space_settings:
  stem: true
  case_insensitive: true
  dimensions: 300
  remove:
    - punctuation
    - singletons
    - numbers
    - stopwords:
        library: nltk
from:
  document_scope: line
  files:
    - paragraph.txt
~~~
* **name** specifies the name of the newly created space that will be used when
referring to the space elsewhere and controls the directory that files will be
placed in for this space.
* **space_settings** specifies details about how LSA is performed
    * *stem* is either "true" or "false" depending on if words should be passed
    into the Porter Stemmer.
    * *case_insensitive* is either "true" or "false" depending on 
* **from** specifies details about the documents that for the basis of the 
space.


Options
---
Options specifies global options that will apply to all tasks run.
